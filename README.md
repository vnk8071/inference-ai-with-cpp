# Inference Machine & Deep Learning with Cpp

Projects: [**Logistic Regression**](#logistic-regression-on-c) | [**Detectron2**](#inference-detectron2-on-c) | [**Try your best**](#try-your-best-)

The goal of these projects is to improve model training time and give optimal inference results.

Use CMake to configure on Linux system for these projects.

Setup CMake

```bash
bash cmake-setup.sh
```

Check CMake installed `cmake --version`

## Logistic Regression on C++

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vnk8071/inference-ai-with-cpp.git
cd logistic-regression
```

See README.md for more details in Logistic-Regression-Cpp

## Inference Detectron2 on C++

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vnk8071/inference-ai-with-cpp.git
cd detectron2
```

See README.md for more details in Detectron2-Cpp

Follow my repo detectron2-object-detection to see training process.

## Inference Computer Vision on C++

Requirements:

- OpenCV
- CMake
- ONNX Runtime

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vnk8071/inference-ai-with-cpp.git
cd lite-ai-toolkit
```
